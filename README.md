Syracuse University, Stefano Chiarella
Project Timeline: October 3 - November 28 2019
Members collaborated with: Forough Jafari (Graduate), Sneha Sarkar (Graduate), Jacquelyn Brozyna (Undergraduate)

My contributions to the project: Designed a prototype website based on wireframe designed by Ms. Jafari. The application was built to aid those hard of hearing navigate public spaces such as airports. The website includes features such as a speech-to-text interface mechanism and a simple interface recognizing Google Maps, as well media and common phrases specifically used for the public space. Designed and developed the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Acknowledgments
This work was driven under teachings in the CIS400/600 Human Computer Interaction course at Syracuse University. Additional aid from the College of Visual and Performing Arts and College of Engineering and Computer Science was considered through the progress of the semester research project. We would like to Dr. Mark Costa and Dr. Leanne Hirshfield for their contributions in steps to guide the research and background information on physiological computing as a sub-field in the human computer interaction subject area.
